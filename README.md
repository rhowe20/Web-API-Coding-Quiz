# JavaScript Coding Quiz

In this project, we were tasked at creating a coding quiz that took the user from question to question, allowed the user to save their high score, and then saved the high score to the local storage.

## Installation

Follow the link below to open the webpage for the my portfolio website.

```bash

```

## Usage 

Throughout the quiz, the user is prompted to select answers that believe are correct. The first page explains the quiz and shows the timer, start button, and allows user to go to the high sore page.

Once the user clicks the start button, they are taken to the first question and the timer starts.

If the answer the user selects is correct, an alert will pop up letting them know. If not, then another alert will pop stating they were incorrect.

Once they have completed the quiz, they will be notified of their score and asked if they would like to save their scores to the high score page.

If they answer yes, they are taken to the high score page to submit their score and have it saved on their local storage.

## Corrections to be made

While this assignment was a challenge and very fun, I am still having trouble grasping certain elements. I was unable to get the local storage information to stay on the page after refreshed. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you.
