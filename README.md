# JavaScript Coding Quiz

In this project, we were tasked at creating a coding quiz that took the user from question to question, allowed the user to save their high score, and then saved the high score to the local storage.

The Portfolio page shows examples of my work and allows user to get an idea of what I can do. At this time, I am still growing my portfolio. Unfortunately, this means I do not have anything to show as of yet.

![Contact Us Page](https://github.com/rhowe20/Rebecca-Howe-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/contactUs.png) 

The Contact Us page allows users to contact me if they want to learn more about what I can do.

The footer allows user to go to my social media pages. This includes my Linkden, Facebook, and Twitter.
